# MyBrush
MyBrush is a coordinated multiple view interface and a proof of concept prototype that offers personal agency over brushing and linking by giving people the flexibility to configure the source, link, and target of multiple brushes.

## getting started

### local installation

If you don't have npm, download and install node.js (including npm) from https://nodejs.org/en/

To install all dependencies/libraries needed in MyBrush, run `npm install` in the root directory of the project.

Now you can serve the index.html file from localhost to run the application and open it in the browser.

One way to do this:

run `npm install http-server -g`  to install a simple command line server

run `http-server .` in the root directory of the project: it will tell you the address to open the application in the browser.

## notes

MyBrush was developed and tested in the Google Chrome browser.


## touch interaction

To disable swipe for navigating back in the browser history,  disable "Overscroll history navigation" in chrome://flags.
